  //!your solution should be inside the function.
  //1-Use a for loop to iterate over the ages array and double each age. Store the doubled ages in a new array called doubledAges and Print the doubledAges array to the console.

  //2-Use the forEach method to loop through the ages array and print each age to the console.

  //3-Use the filter method to create a new array called adults that contains only ages greater than or equal to 18.

  //4-Use the map method to create a new array called ageStrings that contains string representations of each age in the ages array.

  //5-please make sure to name your arrays(variables) accordingly to the names in the return statement.
